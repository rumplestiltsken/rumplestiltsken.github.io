<h4 style="color:#0000CC">*A guide for any coach at any level, from no experience to lifelong players and coaches, of how to get out of the way and allow anyone to learn to play the game of soccer.*</h3> 
<p style="color:white">If you're looking for a season's worth of soccer practice for any skill level up to age 12, and that's all you really want, continue reading about <I>FUNiño</I>. <br>

<h2 style="color:#000099">What is FUNiño?</h2>
<h3 style="color:#0000CC">Fútbol a la medida del niño = soccer tailor-made for children</h3>
<p style="color:#000080">A player development program created by Horst Wein of Germany, based on a 3v3 game with variations, which is the result of over
20 years of innovation, practice and continued improvement that formed the basis of the official coaching manual of the (RFEF)
Royal Spanish Football Federation beginning in 1993 and has been used by F.C. Barcelona, Monterrey, Club America, Inter Milan,
and many other top youth academies around the world. This proven approach to introducing young children to the game of soccer
obviously has an emphasis on FUN so that children come to fall in love with the game from the earliest ages.</p>
<h1 style="color:#000066">FUNiño is joy!</h1>
<h2 style="color:#000099">How does it work?</h2>

<h3 style="color:#0000CC">The Basic Rules</h3>
<ul style="color:#000080">
<li>Each team has 3 players and one substitute.</li>
<li>Players rotate in after each goal or every 2-3 minutes.</li>
<li>The coach starts the game by throwing the
ball in the air in the center of the pitch.</li>
<li>After a goal the game is restarted at the half
line by the team that was scored against.</li>
<li>No throw ins. If the ball goes out of play, the attacking
player restarts the game by placing the ball on the
ground and then passing or dribbling.</li>
<li>Goal kicks are restarted anywhere in the 6-yard defensive
scoring zone. The player may pass or dribble the ball.</li>
<li>Instead of a corner kick, the ball is put in play at the edge of the
attacking scoring zone. The player may pass or dribble the ball.</li>
<li>No static positions.</li>
<li>No offside.</li>
<li>No goalkeepers.</li>

<h2 style="color:#000099">Game Variations</h2>
<ul>
<li>All team members of the attacking team must touch the ball before scoring a goal. (reset when possession is lost)</li>
<li>Three balls on the field to start the game. (begin with three 1v1’s and play until all balls are scored)</li>
<li>In order to score, the attacker must dribble the ball over the endline between either wide goal.</li>
<li>After scoring, the attacking team gets the ball again and can attack the goals at the other end.</li>
<li>To score, the attacking team must play a back pass from the opponent’s endline.</li>

<h2 style="color:#000099">Why FUNiño?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Players develop a love of the game and greater numbers
return to play the following year.</li>
<li>Less interruptions, less lecturing, less lines (queues), less
drills, less laps and running without the ball = less frustration
for children and more time enjoying the game.</li>
<li>Playing in games facilitates free expression and discovery for children.</li>
<li>Age appropriate step by step training. Children do not train like adults.</li>
<li>There is a high level of engagement and many goals scored.</li>
<li>The players self-esteem and confidence grows as they develop.</li>
<li>Players develop technical ability that is applied in a game realistic setting. </li>
<li>Players enhance their level of peripheral vision and perception.</li>
<li>The result is, that, over time, you develop more intelligent players who
become independent of the coach. This has important long-term implications.</li>
<li>Soccer becomes a unifying (not divisive force in society) promoting the
virtues of patience, friendship, generosity and hope for the greater good.</li></ul>

<p>Kris Van Der Haegen, head of the Belgian Football Association, talks about how the Belgian FA embraced FUNiño in <a href="https://youtu.be/3jht1cEYZlQ"> this video.</a>

You'll find many YouTube videos such as <a href="https://youtu.be/IQv4v57Vrc8">this one<a/> that demonstrate how FUNiño works.
